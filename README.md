# vgg-pytorch
VGG models recreated in PyTorch.

These models are created from scratch using the [VGG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) and PyTorch 2.0.1\
Sequential models are used to create layers.

I included some basic utilities for training and testing processes.\
The code is device agnostic (detects the correct device).

CIFAR10 dataset is used for training and testing models.\
Feel free to use this work and test with different datasets!
